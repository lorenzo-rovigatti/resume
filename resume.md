## achievements

**Fusion:** a web-application/system built for Dragonfly Technologies to be used within there organisation helping them provision, automate, monitor and manage customers infrastructure – web-applications, VM’s, cluster, router, firewalls etc. . Primarily the applications utilised an concept called services – these where graph based work flows, all of which was customisable via a react front-end. Each node could be some sort of task (python script, Ansible playbook etc.). These tasks would then be run inside the customers network via a micro-service component called a satellite. Depending on how that task went (succeeded or failed) would then determine how the rest of the work flow would run. These services could also then be published to a customer portal, allowing service catalogue items to be selected and run.

**Discovery tool:** a tool developed for Telstra allowing for finding of assets and network devices on a network without knowing what is there in the first place. The engine works by connecting to a set of know devices – collects data from them and then attempts to ‘crawl’ (ssh to any devices that device has knowledge of) – and in doing so being able to traverse a complex network structure to find all devices that are currently connected on that network.

**End-to-end selenium testing suite:** a client-side testing suite implemented with server tests, utilising selenium, Docker and py-test allowing end-to-end testing of web applications. The framework provides a simple methodology for working through web pages via xpath's, allowing for DOM object waiting/checking.

## projects

**[textual-game-of-life](https://github.com/thomascrha/textual-game-of-life)** an implementation of Conway's game of life (cellular automata) in the terminal using textual.
