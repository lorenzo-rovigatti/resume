## Summary of Scientific Achievements

As of August 2nd, 2024, I have published 2 book chapters and 70 articles in international peer-reviewed scientific journals. I am first, co-first and/or corresponding author of 35 of those publications, and the majority (39) does not feature my Ph.D. supervisor. Publications include (IF impact factor): 1 Science (IF 44.7), 7 ACS Nano (IF 15.88), 1 Physical Review X (IF 15.76), 1 Nature Communications (IF 14.92), 1 Nature Chemical Biology (IF 12.154), 1 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA (IF 11.2), 5 Physical Review Letters (IF 9.161). According to Google Scholar my H-index is 35 and my work has been cited 3423 times, according to Scopus my H-index is 31 and my work has been cited 2654 times.

Here is a list of my major research achievements:

* The development of a computational technique based on the Boolean satisfiability principle that can be used to inverse-design soft materials and finite-sized nanostructures [L. Rovigatti et al, Nanoscale, 14, 14268 (2022) and J. Russo et al, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 34, 354002 (2022)]. We recently used this method to experimentally assemble a highly-coveted three-dimensional lattice made of DNA origami (Liu et al, Science, 384, 776 (2024)).
* The discovery of an entropic mechanism that can be leveraged to control the thermodynamics of associative polymers, which can be made to phase separate or not depending on the sequence and position of the attractive monomers that decorate each chain [L. Rovigatti and F. Sciortino, Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 074801 (2022) and L. Rovigatti and F. Sciortino, SciPost Physics 15, 163 (2023)]
* A joint numerical/theoretical analysis of the structural and dynamical properties of disordered polymer networks, demonstrating the importance of short chains and excluded-volume interactions in real polymer networks [V. Sorichetti et al, J. Chem. Phys., 158, 074905 (2023) and Macromolecules 54, 3769-3779 (2021)]
* A joint theoretical, numerical and experimental work that introduces a method to generate protein assemblies with tunable phase diagrams in living cells to investigate the thermodynamics and dynamics of biomolecular condensates [M. Heidenreich et al, Nat. Chem. Biol., 16, 939-945 (2020)]
* The first numerical check of the validity of the Hertzian approximation for the effective interaction between microgels [L. Rovigatti et al, Macromolecules, 52, 4895-4906 (2019)], which follows the development of a new method to assemble realistic microgels in a computer [N. Gnan et al, Macromolecules, 50, 8777-8786 (2017)], that has been used in tens of publications.
* The development of oxDNA, a coarse-grained model (implemented in a popular open-source code) that has been used in hundreds of publications, listed here: https://dna.physics.ox.ac.uk/index.php/Publications.
* The first numerical observation of a re-entrant gas-liquid spinodal in off-lattice models [L. Rovigatti et al, J. Chem. Phys., 146, 041103 (2017)]. This phenomenon was proposed as a possible explanation for the apparent divergence of the compressibility and specific heat of supercooled water but has never been observed before in real substances nor off-lattice simulations. This is linked to the first numerical observation of a single-component system with two critical points [L. Rovigatti et al, Phys. Rev. Lett., 111, 168302 (2013)]. We demonstrated that this peculiar phenomenon is due to the interplay between phase separation and self-assembly that takes place at low temperature.
* First numerical evidence for the absence of a critical point in the hard sphere fluid [L. Rovigatti et al, Phys. Rev. Lett., 107, 237801 (2011), L. Rovigatti et al, Soft Matter, 8, 6310-6319 (2012)]. We show that the self-assemly of rings at low temperature stabilises the gas phase, thus suppressing phase separation.
